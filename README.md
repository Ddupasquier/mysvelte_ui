# Svelte component library in the making. 
This is a young project so shut up and watch for updates.

In order to use the components, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
npm i mysvelte-ui
```

## Documentation pending, but the button accepts:
disabled: boolean

background: string

color: string

size: string (xsmall, small, medium, large, xlarge)

The content of the button is determined by slotting the content.
```ts
<Button>{slotted content}</Button>
```
