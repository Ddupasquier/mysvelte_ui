## Svelte component library in the making

Welcome to MySvelteUI, a Svelte component library designed to streamline the development process. Our library provides a collection of reusable components that are easy to use and integrate into your Svelte projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, MySvelteUI offers simplicity and efficiency to enhance your workflow.

Please note that this project is still in development, so expect regular updates and improvements. Documentation is also a work in progress and will be added soon.

## Getting Started

### For Users

To use MySvelteUI in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the `mysvelte-ui` package from npm:
```cmd
npm install mysvelte-ui
```

2. Import the desired components into your Svelte project's script tag:
```js
import { Button } from 'mysvelte-ui';
```

3. Use the imported components in your Svelte template:
```js
<Button>Content</Button>
```

That's it! You can now use MySvelteUI components in your project. Enjoy!

### For Developers

If you're a developer and want to contribute to MySvelteUI or fork the repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Ddupasquier/mysvelte_ui.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cmd
cd mysvelte_ui
```

3. Install the project dependencies:
```cmd
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```cmd
npm run dev
```

5. (Optional) To add a new component, you can use the following command:
```cmd
npm run newcomp componentname
```

Replace componentname with the desired name of your new component. This command will scaffold a new component template for you. Please note that the componentname should be in singular form.

The newcomp script fully incorporates the component into MySvelteUI, including adding it to the navigation and making it accessible for import and use in other parts of the library.

That's it! You're now ready to develop and contribute to MySvelteUI. Happy coding!
